    <h3>My <span>Career</span> So Far</h3>
    <p>It has been a rather interesting ride. My interest in software development was as a result of my facination about technology. I have overtime tried out different career path like social media marketing , Digital marketing and a little bit of graphic design. Also design , i love designing. I have also tired out some couple of projects with figma , but realized i didn't like to miss out on all the action so i ditched project management . So i am here doing what i love doing best -solving your problems with my digital solutions. </p>
